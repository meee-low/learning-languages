This is a repo where I try to complete some simple programs in all of the following languages:

- Scala
- Java
- Go
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Julia
- Haskell
- Bash
- Python

  - Hello world with input
  - Hello world to everyone in an external file
  - Read CSV into structs
- Math and Algorithms
  - Fizzbuzz
  - Anagram checker
  - Matrix operations (multiplication, vectors, determinants)
  - Linked Lists
  - Quadtree
  - Rot13
  - Factorial (recursive and non-recursive)
  - Fibonacci (recursive and non-recursive)
  - KMP
  - Levenshtein distance
  - Graph: Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Invert binary tree
  - BFS and DFS
  - A\*
- Games/Automata/Visualizations
  - Rule 0010
  - Snake
  - Tic-tac-toe
  - Game of Life
  - Boids
  - Adventure game from Json
